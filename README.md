# Emberfire Utilities

This addon provides some useful utilities on top of [Emberfire](https://github.com/firebase/emberfire).

## Features

* Multi-path updates
* Storage uploads
* Queries on flattened structure
* Dynamic queries for infinite scroll

## Compatibility

This addon currently supports Ember CLI 2.8.0 that comes with Ember.js 2.8-LTS.

I'm planning to support only the latest [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/) that comes with the latest LTS 
version of Ember.js. No other tests will be made for other versions. In addition, this addon's dependency of 
Emberfire would be of the latest version that's compatible with the Ember CLI mentioned earlier.
